# Overview

This software was used to help me learn Typescript. In it, I create a dropdown menu of a list of Chinese characters, and then created a drawing app. This was helpful in learning about DOM manipulation in Typescript.

The purpose of this software was to help people practice writing Chinese characters. I placed a drawing app on the screen and then a dropdown menu of a view different characters, that when selected, shows a bigger picture of the character. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this software I used Typescript, as well as a linter. I used only a little bit of HTML and CSS as well.

# Useful Websites

- (https://kernhanda.github.io/tutorial-typescript-canvas-drawing/): I forked the code from this to create the drawing app.

# Future Work

- I want to add more characters to the list
- I want to add an erase feature, so that you don't have to entirely clear the app
- I need to figure out how to stop showing the name of the picture
